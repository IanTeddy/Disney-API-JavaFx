# 🧞‍♂️ Disney Movie API with JavaFx

The project aims to create an interactive application in JavaFX that will allow users to access information from an API. I chose "The Disney Animation Movies API" to retrieve information about Disney animation movies, including their title, runtime, rating, and more. This project is built using IntelliJ, maven, and the MVC architectural patterns. 



## 🤔 What is an API?
API is an Application Programming Interface.  It is used to transfer information between two systems.  Often the file is transferred in JSON format.  This time I used GSON (Google’s JSON utility) to convert JSON data into objects.

## 🎪 Feature
- Integrated external CSS to style scenes, including background images and text colors.
